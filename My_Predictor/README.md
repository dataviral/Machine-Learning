# Simple Predictor

Requirements:
	- A PC running python :)

- This Predicton Models Uses means of different features of different class to predict which class an input test case belongs to
- Displays Accuracy on the data set
- The simplicity of this code

Class Predictor() :
	

	Routines ->
		0. __init__(classes,features,data): [Constructor] 

			# Arguments	
			classes : List all classes
			features : List all features
			data : array of  dictionary of dictionary 

		1. calcNoOfDataSets() : Does as the name suggests. Used internally

		2. dataMeanCalc() : calculates mean of all the features of every class

		3. classPredictor() : Predicts which class input test casr belongs to

		4. predictorAccuracy() : Just calculates the accuracy 

		5. printDataPredictAcc() : Same as Routine 1
